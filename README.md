# HtmlCssGuide
This document defines formatting and style rules for HTML and CSS. It aims at improving collaboration, and code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure. It applies to raw, working files that use HTML and CSS, including GSS files. Tools are free to obfuscate, minify, and compile as long as the general code quality is maintained.
